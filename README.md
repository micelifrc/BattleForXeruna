# Battle For Xeruna
A strategy turn-based game, inspired by Battle for Wesnoth, with an innovative turn structure, and with a totally deterministic battle system. It support either 2 or 3 players.

This basic turn-based game is played on an hexagonal-based map, and is inspired by Battle for Wesnoth, with 3 key differences:
1) the game supports 3 players, which is arguably the most interesting scenario, because 2 players may choose to cooperate. This seems to be rare in strategy games;
2) the battle system is fully deterministic, meaning that there are no luck-based rolls. In this way luck will never play a role in Battle for Xeruna;
3) turns are based on units, instead of players (like in D&D). This will speed-up turns, meaning that players will not have to wait long times waiting for the other players, and it reduces the turn-swing effect (in which eevry player seems to get a huge advantage during his own turn).

This is a game I am fully developing, as a solo developer, despite my lack of experience both in game design, and especially in graphics.
The game is developed using Unity, with C#. The images and animations are creted with Blender. I am currently very inexperienced in all of them.

The models of the game were realized using Blender. The soundtrack was realized using BoscaCeoil.
